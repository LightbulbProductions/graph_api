THINGS TO REMEMBER
* Stop typing out integer, it is int 
* not GRAPHQL... just GraphQL

When it all sneak with the background server
* cntrl z to "sleep" process, 
* Run lsof -wni tcp:3000 to find out PID number 
* and run kill -9 11111 (whatever the number)
* really, try not to take a shortcut. Issue was created with comments in rb file, fyi
